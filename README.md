# PfaffianPhylogeneticNetworks
This repository contains supplementary files for our recent paper "The Pfaffian Structure of CFN Phylogenetic Networks". 
For a detailed explanation of the files within we refer the user to our MathRepo page https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/MPfaffianPhylogeneticNetworks/index.html or our paper.

The main files contained here are:

PfaffianPhyloNets.m2: a Macaulay2 file which contains a computational proof of Lemma 3.7 which states that our proposed generating set is a Groebner basis for sunlet networks from n = 5 to n=11
